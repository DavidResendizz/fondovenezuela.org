            <b> Fondo Venezuela </b>(or Venezuela Fund in English) is a mixed fund of associated communities, non-profit organizations, individuals and companies identified with freedom values, concerned about the very particular socio-economic situation of the Venezuelan people. We rely on the generosity around the world and technologies to help.  
            <br><br>
            It is impossible to stay inert before tyranny, crisis and need. Venezuela is a country abducted, plundered and destroyed. With <a href="https://apoyo.savethechildren.mx/crisis-migratoria-venezuela" target="_blank">Save The Children,</a> Fondo Venezuela aims to help thousands of children on the border with Colombia, who had fled from their country, and with <a href="https://www.bitcoinvenezuela.com/" target="_blank">Bitcoin Venezuela</a> we will help several thousand more within the nation that continues resisting. We not only want to provide relief but to give hope, let them know <b>they are not alone.</b>
            <br><br>

            In this project, there is not and there won’t be a great number of concentrated efforts in a single entity so that we avoid it becoming <i>“the fund of [company here]”</i>. However, everyone is welcome to contribute with something. We need the help of the community to make this project the best it can be. <b>Honorable Allies</b> is a team to help build Fondo Venezuela, and the legend says that there are <b>5 epic groups</b> to which you can belong:

            <h2><a class="nohighlight" href="#nextsteps" name="nextsteps"> Ambassador's Program - Raising Funds</a></h2>
            The mission of an ambassador is to contact companies and/or people that you think are interested in donating in your industry, country or continent. Unlike the messenger, you maintain direct contact with potential donors. We are looking for communities and influential individuals, but this role can be played by companies and NGO’s too.

            <br><br>

            If you or your entity is from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, México, Spain, United States, rest of Europe or Asia-Pacific, consider yourself in. We want at least one node in each of these places.

You could even donate directly to <b>Bitcoin Venezuela</b> or <b>Save The Children</b> in the meantime.
